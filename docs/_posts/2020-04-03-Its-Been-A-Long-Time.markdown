Just a couple minutes ago I thought to check that my SSL certificate for this site was still valid. It‚Äôs good ‚Äì Cloudflare is handling that part.

Then I looked at my last (and only) post. Noticed it was from 2018. TWENTY EIGHTEEN. Two friggin years ago. Of course I spotted a few typos and fixed them.. Yeah, I‚Äôve been either busy, occupied, or disconnected. Today I‚Äôve been up since about 4am due to The Wife snoring. My normal wake up time is 5:30am. So I‚Äôve had a little time to tinker this morning.

What have I been working on? I‚Äôm going to make this list for me, and maybe you‚Äôll see something interesting.

* Work

  * Windows Server 2019 Core
  * Grafana + InfluxDB + Telegraf
